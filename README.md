# About #
I am an undergraduate neuroscience student at Dalhousie University in Halifax, NS. My research interests lie primarily in the areas of neuroimaging techniques, neurological trauma and public health.

# Code Samples #

Here is an example of code I wrote for analyzing the causes of [traumatic brain injuries leading to death in children and young adults](2020-10-29-230913.ipynb). This is some futher analysis of the [root causes of traumatic brain injuries]() across six age groups. [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/traumatic-brain-injury-tbi)


Here is an example of code I wrote to visualize the [initial COVID-19 outbreak](Covid0.ipynb) in 5 major countries. This code allows further analysis and exploration into the [average death rates in confirmed cases of COVID-19](Covid2.ipynb) in 5 major countries.
