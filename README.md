# Stephen J. Snow's Portfolio
Welcome to my professional coding portfolio!
I am an undergraduate student at Dalhousie University in Halifax, NS. 




Here is example of code I wrote for analyzing the [causes of traumatic brain injuries leading to death in children and young adults](2020-10-29-230913.ipynb).

This is some futher analysis of the [root cause of traumatic brain injuries across six age groups]().

Opensource dataset available from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/traumatic-brain-injury-tbi)


Here is an example of code I wrote to visualize the [initial COVID-19 outbreak in 5 major countries](Covid1 (1).ipynb).

This analysis allows further eploration into the [average death rates in confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 5 major countries](Covid2.ipynb).
