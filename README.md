# Stephen J. Snow's Portfolio
Welcome to my professional coding portfolio!

I am an undergraduate neuroscience student at Dalhousie University in Halifax, NS. My research interests lie primarily in the areas of neuroimaging techniques, neurological trauma and public health.


Here is an example of code I wrote for analyzing the causes of [traumatic brain injuries leading to death in children and young adults](2020-10-29-230913.ipynb).

This is some futher analysis of the [root cause of traumatic brain injuries]() across six age groups. [Database](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/traumatic-brain-injury-tbi)


Here is an example of code I wrote to visualize the [initial COVID-19 outbreak](Covid1.ipynb) in 5 major countries.

This code allows further analysis and exploration into the [average death rates in confirmed cases of COVID-19](Covid2.ipynb) in 5 major countries. [Database](https://www.kaggle.com/ashudata/covid19dataset)
