## About
Under the direction of Dr. Tim Bardouille, I have spent time volunteering in Dalhousie's [Biosignal Lab](https://www.dal.ca/sites/biosignal-lab.html), which uses advanced imaging technologies to non-invasively study activity in the brain. My research interests lie primarily in the areas of neuroimaging techniques, neurological trauma and public health. Below are some samples of python code I have written for the analysis and visualization of these interests. Thanks for visiting!

# Sample Code

## Neuroimaging

#### [MRI masking](Demo-6final.htm)

This [sample](Demo-6final.htm) uses masks while looping through a series of MRI scans to highlight a patient's recently diagnosed glioblastoma. This sample uses data collected by the [Cancer Imaging Archive](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Brain-Tumor-Progression).

<br> 

#### [Single Neuron Heat Maps](Assign_4_portfin.htm)

This [sample](Assign_4_portfin.htm) visualizes the action potentials of a single neuron recording. This example uses nested for loops, various other pandas functions and matplotlib to create heat maps to visualize the data across all experimental conditions. This sample uses data collected by [Dr. Nathan Crowder](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/psychology_neuroscience/faculty-staff/our-faculty/nathan-crowder.html) of Dalhousie University.

## Neurological Trauma

#### [Brain Injuries in Children and Young Adults](pie_f.htm)
This [sample](pie_f.htm) analyzes the causes of traumatic brain injuries leading to death in children and young adults. 

<br> <br>

#### [Brain Injuries Across All Age Groups](bar_f.htm)
This [sample](bar_f.htm) provides further analysis of the root causes of traumatic brain injuries across four age groups. These samples use data borrowed from [Brain Injury Awareness U.S.A.](https://www.biausa.org/public-affairs/public-awareness/brain-injury-awareness) and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/traumatic-brain-injury-tbi).

<br> <br>

## Public Health

#### [Initial Global Covid Outbreak](COVID-time-fin.htm)
This [sample](COVID-time-fin.htm) illustrates the initial COVID-19 outbreak in 5 major countries. 

<br> <br>

#### [Death Rates in Major Countries](Covid2-fin.html)
This [sample](Covid2-fin.html) allows further analysis and exploration into the average death rates in confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 5 major countries. These samples use data borrowed from an opensource dataset for [COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/ashudata/covid19dataset).
