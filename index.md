# Welcome to my portfolio!


## About #
I am an undergraduate neuroscience student at Dalhousie University in Halifax, NS. My research interests lie primarily in the areas of neuroimaging techniques, neurological trauma and public health.

## Sample Code

### Neurological Trauma
Here is an example of code I wrote for analyzing the causes of [traumatic brain injuries leading to death in children and young adults](2020-10-29-230913.htm). This is some futher analysis of the [root causes of traumatic brain injuries](2020-10-29-163939.html) across six age groups. Opensource dataset for [traumatic brain injuries]. (https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/traumatic-brain-injury-tbi)


### Public Health
Here is an example of code I wrote to visualize the [initial COVID-19 outbreak](Covid1.html) in 5 major countries. This code allows further analysis and exploration into the [average death rates in confirmed cases of COVID-19](Covid2.html) in 5 major countries. Opensource dataset for [COVID-19].
